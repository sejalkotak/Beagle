    <p>Hashtags are a great way to expose your tweet to other users who do not currently follow you. If your objective is to have your tweet seen by as many users as possible using a hashtag is an easy way to start. Choosing the right hashtag is important. With only 140 characters space is at a premium, you have even less if you are trying to get retweeted. So look for a hashtag that is likely to be used by your brandâ€™s demographic.
      This chart shows the top 30 hashtags by popularity on Twitter during last month, for tweets in any language.</p>
